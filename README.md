# data-transformations
Code for transforming data sources for use in research

This repository will initially house the SQL to set up a database that is compatible with the code in [my spatial-visualisations]()
repository and instructions for how to get the UK feed-in tariff data into that database.

Over time, I intend to add any scripts I need to use to maipulate publicly available data before using it in research
examples of this data might be spatially disaggregated energy consumption data, local carbon intensity of electricity
if that ever becomes available and probably other things that I can't think of right now :) ...
